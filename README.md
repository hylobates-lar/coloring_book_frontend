# Color by Nature

Welcome to Color by Nature: A National Parks Digital Coloring Book!

I created this app with a desire to build something that brought together several things I love: nature, color, visuals, interactivity, and creativity. I love how creativity and technology can come together to create amazing products that bring joy to users, and this was something I really wanted to explore. I also liked that this project pushed me to learn new tools that I hadn't experienced yet, such as working with SVGs, Redux, React Hooks, Auth and additional experience with custom CSS. 

Ideally I would also love to use this app to provide fundraising support for the National Parks Foundation. I am constantly in awe of the incredible natural beauty that exists within the national parks, and sincerely hope they will continue to remain protected forever. I would love for each completed/colored-in photo to trigger a small donation to support this cause.

## Features

Color by Nature allows a user to browse national parks coloring pages and select images to color however they wish. 

A user must be logged in to color, and the login will persist until the user clicks 'Logout'. A logged out or new user can view the Image Gallery without logging in, but if they select an image they will be re-directed to the Login page.

A user can:

* log in/create a new account
* browse national parks coloring pages in the Image Gallery
* select colors from the color palette to apply to their chosen image in the Coloring Page
* save an image to their account (The image saves automatically to their account upon selection, and autosaves as each color is applied.)
* view all of their saved images in a gallery (My Images)
* edit a saved image
* download a saved image directly to their device as a png
* delete a saved image
